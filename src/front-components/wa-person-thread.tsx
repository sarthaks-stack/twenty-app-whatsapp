/**
 * The WhatsApp tab on a Person record (FR-UI-1).
 *
 * A host, not a component: everything it does is decide *which* conversation
 * `<ThreadView>` should show. Keeping the hosts this thin is what makes the
 * fallback tiers of specs/08 §10 a routing change — if a record widget turns
 * out to be the wrong place for a chat, this file goes away and the side panel
 * renders the identical view.
 *
 * The id it reads is the **Person**, not the thread. The feed resolves the
 * contact's most recent conversation, and answers an empty state rather than a
 * 404 when there is none — a contact who has never messaged is normal, not an
 * error.
 *
 * `useRecordId()` is deprecated, and so is the `recordId` field it reads;
 * `selectedRecordIds` is the current shape. The fallback stays because a record
 * page is not a selection: if a host ever mounts this widget without seeding
 * the selection, the deprecated field is still the one that answers, and a
 * blank chat would be a silent failure.
