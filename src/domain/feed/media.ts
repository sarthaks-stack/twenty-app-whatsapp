 * references the media, and a cycle between them is the kind of thing that
 * works until a bundler reorders the modules.
 *
 * The shape grew when the renderer registry arrived. `kind`, `url` and a size
 * were enough for "a link and maybe an `<img>`"; they are not enough to tell a
 * voice note from an MP3 somebody attached, to reserve the right box for a
 * portrait video before it loads, or to say how long a recording is without
 * downloading it. Every field below is read from stored media meta on the
 * server, never re-derived in the browser (AR-17).
