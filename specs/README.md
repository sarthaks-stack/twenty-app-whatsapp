# twenty-whatsapp — Implementation Specifications

Implementation-level specs derived from **TRD v1.1 (2026-08-15)**, grounded in the SDK
actually installed in this repo (`twenty-sdk@2.31.0`, `twenty-client-sdk@2.31.0`) and in the
first-party Twenty apps that use the same surfaces (`packages/twenty-apps/public/slack`,
`.../examples/postcard`).

The TRD says *what* and *why*. These specs say *what file, what signature, what algorithm,
what test*. Where the TRD's assumptions did not survive contact with the SDK, the deviation is
recorded in [`00-architecture-decisions.md`](00-architecture-decisions.md) — read that first.

| 06 | [Templates & consent](06-templates-and-consent.md) | Sync, publishing gate, variable binding, opt-in/opt-out |
| 07 | [Campaigns](07-campaigns.md) | Builder, snapshot, exclusions, pre-flight, runner, tier ledger, guardrails |
| 08 | [Front components](08-front-components.md) | All 5 UI surfaces, sandbox constraints, data access, polling budget |
| 09 | [Workflows, timeline & notifications](09-workflows-timeline-notifications.md) | Workflow action, DB-event triggers, timeline activities, notification gap |
| 10 | [Security, roles & permissions](10-security-roles.md) | Secrets, HMAC, roles, consent hard-block, retention, erasure |
| 11 | [Observability & operations](11-observability-operations.md) | Logging, metrics, health, runbook, replay, reverse-proxy config |
| 12 | [Test plan](12-testing.md) | Test matrix mapped to every MUST/SHOULD requirement |
| 13 | [Delivery plan](13-delivery-plan.md) | Workstreams, task breakdown, sequencing, week-1 probes, release gate |
| 14 | [Open questions](14-open-questions.md) | Q-1…Q-16 with owners and deadlines |
| A | [Meta Cloud API surface](appendix-a-meta-api.md) | Exact requests, payloads and webhook shapes used |
| B | [Error catalog](appendix-b-error-catalog.md) | Meta error codes → system behaviour → user-facing copy |
| C | [UUID registry](appendix-c-uuid-registry.md) | Every hand-assigned universal identifier |

## Requirement traceability

Every spec section cites the TRD requirement IDs it implements (`FR-IN-2`, `AR-11`, …).
[`12-testing.md`](12-testing.md) closes the loop: each MUST/SHOULD requirement maps to at least
one named test. A requirement with no test in that table is not release-ready.

## Status conventions used in these documents

- **SPECIFIED** — decided, implementable as written.
- **PROBE** — depends on platform behaviour that must be verified empirically in week 1
  (see [13-delivery-plan.md § Week-1 probes](13-delivery-plan.md#week-1-de-risking-probes)).
  Each PROBE carries a specified fallback so the probe cannot block the workstream.
- **OPEN** — needs a decision from a named owner; tracked in [14-open-questions.md](14-open-questions.md).

## Verified platform facts these specs rely on

These were checked against the installed SDK and the docs, not assumed:

| Fact | Source |
|---|---|
| Server-route webhooks are exposed at `POST /webhooks/server/{resolverUniversalIdentifier}` — the path is **not** author-chosen | `docs/.../logic-functions.md`; `ServerRouteTriggerSettings` has only `forwardedRequestHeaders` |
| A resolver returns `{workspaceId, targetLogicFunctionUniversalIdentifier, payload}` **or** a `Response`; the platform then answers `202 {queued:true}` and runs the target asynchronously | `twenty-sdk/logic-function` `ServerRouteResolverResult`; `slack-events-resolver.ts` |
| `rawBody` is available to the resolver; signature headers must be listed in `forwardedRequestHeaders` | `LogicFunctionEvent.rawBody`; `slack-events-resolver.ts` |
| Node `crypto` (`createHmac`, `timingSafeEqual`) works inside logic functions | `slack/src/logic-functions/utils/verify-slack-request-signature.ts` |
| Cross-workspace routing state lives in `kv` with `scope: 'SERVER'` | `slack/.../find-claimed-workspace-id.ts` |
| Secrets reach logic functions as `process.env.<NAME>`, declared via `serverVariables` in the app config; secrets are never sent to front components | `docs/.../config/application.md`; `slack/src/application.config.ts` |
| Background work is queued with `enqueueJob({logicFunctionUniversalIdentifier, payload, retryLimit, delayMs})` | `twenty-sdk/logic-function` |
| Files are stored via `MetadataApiClient.uploadFile(buffer, filename, contentType, fieldUniversalIdentifier)` → `{id, path, size, url}` | `twenty-client-sdk/metadata` |
| Field universal identifiers can be **derived deterministically** with `getFieldUniversalIdentifier({applicationUniversalIdentifier, objectUniversalIdentifier, name})` (UUID v5) | `twenty-sdk/define`, verified by execution |
| A tab can be added to the stock Person record page via `definePageLayoutTab({pageLayoutUniversalIdentifier: STANDARD_PAGE_LAYOUT.personRecordPage.universalIdentifier, …})` | `docs/.../page-layouts.md`; constant verified present |
| Front components run in a Web Worker sandbox: no `IntersectionObserver`/`ResizeObserver`, no portals, no canvas, no `FileReader`, `scrollTop` assignment is a **no-op**, `document`/`window` listeners never fire | `docs/.../front-components.md` |
| `timelineActivity` is a writable standard object with `targetPerson`, `linkedRecordId`, `linkedObjectMetadataId`, `name`, `happensAt`, `properties` | `STANDARD_OBJECT.timelineActivity` field list |
| Twenty now ships `messageCampaign` / `messageList` / `messageListMember` standard objects (email-oriented) | `STANDARD_OBJECT` — newer than the TRD's platform survey; see D-13 |
| There is **no** notification standard object exposed to apps | Full `STANDARD_OBJECT` enumeration; see D-10 |
