 * Every icon here is exported by `twenty-ui/icon` — the same Tabler set the rest
 * of the workspace draws from — so a status in this app looks like a status in
 * Twenty rather than like an emoji somebody's font substituted. That is the
 * whole reason for the file: the glyphs it replaces (`🟢`, `📣`, `⋯`, `✓✓`)
 * rendered at whatever size and colour the platform's emoji font felt like, and
 * two of them were the *only* thing distinguishing two states.
 *
 * **An icon is never the whole message.** Everything in the map below appears
 * beside its own word, or carries an `aria-label` when the word is genuinely
 * redundant (a send button labelled "Send"). Colour and shape are the third and
 * fourth ways of saying something, never the first.
