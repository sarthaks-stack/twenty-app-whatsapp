/**
 * `server/files.ts` is the only module outside the provider allowed to make an
 * HTTP request, so its origin guard is load-bearing for AR-11 rather than
 * merely defensive. These tests are what keeps the exception narrow — the
 * architecture test asserts the guard exists; these assert it works.
 *
 * The guard changed shape in D-58: the origin is now *rebuilt* rather than
 * *validated*, because validating it refused the only address a rep can
 * actually supply (the front-end host, not the API one) and broke every
 * outbound attachment. The invariant these tests hold to is therefore stronger
 * than the one they held before — every resolved URL is on the workspace API
 * origin, for every input — and the path restriction, which is the part that
 * stops `/rest/people` being read with the app's token, is unchanged.
