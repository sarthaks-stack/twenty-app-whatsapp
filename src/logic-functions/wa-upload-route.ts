/**
 * `POST /s/whatsapp/upload` — bytes produced *in the page* into Twenty storage.
 *
 * This route exists for exactly one thing the front-component sandbox can do
 * and the composer could not use: a `MediaRecorder` hands the page a `Blob` of
 * real audio. The sandbox has no `FileReader` and a file input exposes only
 * metadata, so a device picker still cannot work (spec §"Attachment and
 * file-picker feasibility") — but a recording the page *made* is bytes the page
 * already holds.
 *
 * The client could not upload them itself. Twenty's `uploadFile` lives on the
 * core GraphQL client, which a front component does not carry a token for, and
 * a multipart upload assembled in the sandbox is a request shape nothing else
 * in this app makes. So the page sends base64 to a route that already has the
 * app's identity, and the route does the upload — one narrow, authenticated
 * door rather than a general one.
 *
 * **It is a door, so it is bounded.** An agent role, a hard byte cap checked
 * *before* decoding, and the same `validateOutboundMedia` limits the sender
 * enforces — because a route that accepted any bytes under any name would be a
 * file host with a WhatsApp app around it.
