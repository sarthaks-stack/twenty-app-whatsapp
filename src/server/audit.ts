 * Audited actions (SEC-10, SEC-12).

 * survives a record purge and is what an incident investigation greps, and —
 * where the action concerns a Person — a timeline activity, which is where a
 * colleague looking at the record will actually see it. Neither alone answers
 * the question an auditor asks.
 *
 * The highest-stakes entry is a campaign launch. It records the full audience
 * definition, the recipient count, the exclusion breakdown and the template, so
 * "who sent 5 000 messages, to whom, and on what basis" is answerable months
 * later without reconstructing state that no longer exists.
