/**
 * A contact with no WhatsApp conversation (specs/08 §7, review §"empty state").
 *
 * The screen this replaces said one sentence — "Este contacto ainda não tem
 * conversa de WhatsApp." — in every situation. It was true every time and
 * useful none of them: it read the same whether the contact had unsubscribed,
 * the workspace had no number connected, the contact had no usable phone, or
 * the rep was one click from starting the conversation.
 *
 * So the state branches on the server's own verdict rather than on a guess.
 * `policy` here is evaluated against a conversation that does not exist yet, so
 * its denial *is* the diagnosis: `ACCOUNT_NOT_CONNECTED` is a setup problem,
 * `OPTED_OUT` is a consent problem, and `WINDOW_CLOSED` — the ordinary case —
 * is not a problem at all but the instruction to open with a template.
 *
 * The order matters and follows the gate's own (specs/04 §1): a workspace with
 * no connected number cannot act on consent, so the number is reported first.
