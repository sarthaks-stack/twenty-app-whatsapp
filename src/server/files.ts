/**
 * Reading a file back out of Twenty's own storage (specs/04 §5 step 6, D-18).
 *
 * The composer cannot read file bytes — the front-component sandbox has no
 * `FileReader` — so an outbound attachment is uploaded to Twenty storage first
 * and the send carries only a handle. Somewhere between that handle and Meta's
 * media endpoint, something has to fetch the bytes.
 *
 * **This is the one module outside the provider allowed to make an HTTP
 * request, and the allowance is narrow by construction.** `resolveFileUrl`
 * always returns a URL on the workspace's own API origin, under the file
 * store, so the function cannot be repurposed into a general HTTP client — in
 * particular it cannot be handed Meta's media CDN URL, which is the exact hole
 * AR-11 exists to close. A test asserts the guard is still here, because an
 * exception to an architectural rule that nobody re-checks is just a rule that
 * was dropped.
 *
 * `RestApiClient` from the SDK is deliberately not used: it reads every
 * response with `response.text()`, which corrupts binary content silently.

 * forced to reassemble the base URL would reassemble it wrongly somewhere.
 *
 * **The origin is rebuilt, not validated** (D-58). The previous rule — refuse
 * anything whose origin is not `TWENTY_API_URL` — refused every attachment a
 * rep could actually supply: the panel asks them to "copy the file's address
 * from its record in Twenty", and the address in a browser is the *front-end*
 * host, while `TWENTY_API_URL` is the API one. Every outbound image, video,
 * audio file and PDF failed on it, with a message about Meta that named the
 * wrong system entirely. Taking `pathname` and `search` and re-hanging them on
 * the API origin is *stronger* than the check it replaces: the fetch target is
 * now workspace-origin by construction rather than by validation, so no input
 * — a hostile one included — can make this module talk to another host.
 *
 * The path restriction survives untouched, and it is the load-bearing one.
 * `fileUrl` and `filePath` arrive from route callers, so without it any agent
 * could name `/rest/people?...`, have this module fetch the authenticated JSON
 * with `TWENTY_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and send the workspace's CRM data to a
 * WhatsApp number as a "document" — an exfiltration channel, not a file read.
