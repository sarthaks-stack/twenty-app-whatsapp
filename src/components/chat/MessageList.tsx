/**
 * The transcript (specs/08 §3.1, D-7, NFR-P4, spec §"Layout rules").
 *
 * There is no scripted scrolling in this file, and there cannot be: the sandbox
 * throws on `.scrollIntoView()` and ignores writes to `scrollTop`. The whole
 * design rests on `flex-direction: column-reverse`, where the browser's own
 * anchoring keeps the visual bottom pinned as rows are added to the *start* of
 * the array, and preserves the reader's position when older rows are added to
 * the *end*. The messages are therefore held newest-first — not sorted for
 * display, but stored that way, so the DOM order and the array order agree.
 *
 * Two things are new, and both are layout the review measured as broken:
 *
 * **The conversation lane.** At 919 px, inbound messages hugged the far left
 * and outbound the far right, leaving a dead zone down the middle and no sense
 * that the two sides were talking to each other. The rows are now centred in a
 * 640–720 px lane, which is the width at which a conversation reads as one.
 *
 * **`@container`, never `@media`.** The pane's width is what matters, not the
 * browser window's — this component renders in an inbox detail pane, a record
 * side panel and a full-width tab, and a window breakpoint would give the
 * narrow panel a desktop layout whenever the desktop was wide.
 *
 * Day separators are computed during render rather than stored, because the day
 * a message belongs to depends on the reader's time zone rule (Africa/Luanda)
 * and not on anything the server can bake in.
